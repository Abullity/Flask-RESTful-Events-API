# RESTful Flask App
A simple Flask based RESTful events/calendar Web API

The project inspired by one of JetBrains Academy projects.

# What does the API do

API takes POST, GET and DELETE requests and updates, retrieves or delets an event 
an event is a json data, which has attributes:

• event (the name of the event)

• date 

• location

The API can retrieve all the events, an event by id or events filtered by starting and ending dates

you could add any event you'd like but by default, app has couple of SpaceX flight events saved in database

you can delete the database and it will be reinitialized from program launch

all the data is saved in sqlite database and thus is persistent over program termination/relaunch

detailed inforamtion on POST request's body data-format as well as routes and methods available for given routes are given on API's root page

# Installation and dependencies

App uses Flask-RESTful framework

The required modules (Including Flask, Flask-RESTful and Flask_Sqlalchemy) are given in requirements.txt file, which was generated by 'pip freeze' command.

To install required modules run 'pip -r requirements.txt' command from project's root directory

After you have every package installed, execute run.py file, the rest should work without issues.



#Running the app

Open terminal in project's root directory and run the following command

"python run.py"

or

"python3 run.py"

The command takes two arguments host address and port,
you don't have to specify these and by default the app will be run on localhost port 5000 ---> http://127.0.0.1:5000/


# Routes

1) main route, sends information about other routes and their methods --> "/"


2) event route, sends all events if query parameters not specified -->  "/event"
  
  You could send get request to event route with start_time and end_time parameteres,
  which will retrieve events filter with lower or upper boundaries of event dates
  
  So a GET request could look like the following three:
  
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/event?start_time=2021-06-21   
  
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/event?end_time=2021-08-20
  
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/event?start_time=2021-06-21&end_time=2021-08-20
  
  to post your own event you could use python's requests module and its method post, or you could use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
  
 
  
  data for the POST method should have following attributes:
  
    "event": "Name for an event",
    
    "date": "Date for an event in format YYYY-MM-DD",
    
    "location": "Location for an event"
    
    
3) single event by id route, gets an event if the id matches requested event id --> "/event/[known_event_id]"
  
  an exmaple would be a GET request http://127.0.0.1:5000/event/2 
  
  same route with DELETE method would delete the event from database
  
  this request would return event with ID of 2, if it exsisted
  
  
4) today's events routes, returns all events that are due today --> "/event/today"
